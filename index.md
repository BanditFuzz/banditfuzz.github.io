# BanditFuzz

BanditFuzz is a multi-agent reinforcement learning guided performance fuzzing algorithm. BanditFuzz has extensively been considered in the context of Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT)  solvers. BanditFuzz constructs inputs that expose performance issues in a set of target solvers relative to a set of reference solvers. The `banditfuzz` tool is the first performance fuzzer that supports the entirety of the theories in the SMT-LIB initiative.

The BanditFuzz team would like to thank Aina Niemetz, Mathias Periner, Martin Brain, Murphy Berzish, and Mitja Kulczynski for their feedback while the project was under development.

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
